# MADELON

MADELON is an artificial dataset containing data points grouped in 32 clusters placed on the vertices of a five dimensional hypercube and randomly labeled +1 or -1. The five dimensions constitute 5 informative features. 15 linear combinations of those features were added to form a set of 20 (redundant) informative features. Based on those 20 features one must separate the examples into the 2 classes (corresponding to the +-1 labels). We added a number of distractor feature called 'probes' having no predictive power. The order of the features and patterns were randomized.
